# Reactful MERN APP W/ Reduxed Ecommerce #


This is a large full stack application that incorporates React, React-Router, Redux. Firestore as Authentication and Product database, and Stripe for payment processing. 


----------



This is fully functional Web application that an individual or development team may upsert their information, design, and database and immediately deploy. There has been intentionality in our file structure and naming conventions to allow for easiest and quickest understanding of what every component, file, line of code, even comments are for in the app. 

----------

The styling was done with Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) to simplify conversion from one theme to another. We have left out all styled components as to not enter into any discussion of the merits or even if they should be used or not. We believe that this is a personal choice and we do not want to make that decision for you, just let your conscience be your guide.  


**## Installation ##

easiest route with this application would be to create-react-app and download the source code into the folder you just created, overwriting those files with the downloaded ones. Then `$ npm install --save`, this will download the projects dependencies and install them, creating node_modules folders. npm run dev will launch the dev environment and local server. Once you are ready to deploy simply `$ npm run build` and this will build the app for production to the build folder and it will correctly bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for best performance. At this point you are ready to deploy, Congrats!
